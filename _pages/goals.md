The main goal in CONSERVA3 is to evaluate the status of endemic and threatened *Thymus* species, in order to establish conservation priorities that can be used by conservation managers. This goal implies the following specific objectives:

1. Determine the genetic diversity of the taxa under study

2. Quantify reproductive success and factors that limit reproduction in the taxa studied

3. Determine the ecological niche and biogeographic distribution patterns of the three taxa at the species and population level

4. Analyze the sexual and chemical polymorphisms in the populations of these taxa

5. Determine the influence of genetic diversity, chemotype and sex ratio variability on the reproductive success of the studied populations, and its consequences for conservation

6. Interpret the biogeographic and evolutionary processes that operate in each taxon, and identify the populations/areas with greater genetic originality, as support for the definition of management priorities.

7. Detect the vulnerability of the studied populations, and predict the potential long-term viability of the target endemic taxa in different climatic scenarios

8. Disseminate the results of the project to the competent authorities

9. Stimulate the sensitivity of the local population for plant conservation
